# DevOps Intelligence Agent - Demo Script

## 3-Minute Demo Video Script

### Introduction (0:00 - 0:30)

**[Screen: Landing page with agent UI]**

"Hi, I'm excited to show you the DevOps Intelligence Agent - an AI-powered assistant that helps DevOps teams manage infrastructure, optimize costs, analyze code, and troubleshoot issues autonomously using AWS Bedrock."

**[Highlight key features on screen]**

"Built entirely on AWS using Bedrock for reasoning, DynamoDB for storage, and integrated with multiple AWS services, this agent demonstrates true autonomous decision-making with human-in-the-loop safety."

### Demo 1: Infrastructure Analysis (0:30 - 1:00)

**[Screen: Chat interface]**

"Let's start with infrastructure management. I'll ask the agent to analyze my AWS resources."

**Type**: "Analyze my AWS infrastructure and suggest optimizations"

**[Show agent response]**

"Watch as the agent:
1. Reasons about what information it needs
2. Plans its actions
3. Executes tools to query EC2, Lambda, and S3
4. Provides specific, actionable recommendations"

**[Highlight reasoning panel]**

"Notice the reasoning panel showing its thought process - this is the autonomous reasoning powered by AWS Bedrock."

### Demo 2: Cost Optimization (1:00 - 1:30)

**[Screen: New query]**

"Now let's look at cost optimization."

**Type**: "What are my top cost drivers this month and how can I reduce them?"

**[Show agent response]**

"The agent automatically:
- Queries AWS Cost Explorer
- Analyzes spending patterns
- Identifies optimization opportunities
- Provides specific cost-saving recommendations"

**[Point to actions taken]**

"See the actions panel showing exactly what tools were used - complete transparency in the agent's workflow."

### Demo 3: Code Analysis (1:30 - 2:00)

**[Screen: Code analysis demo]**

"The agent also does code analysis. Let me paste a Python function."

**Type**: "Review this code for security issues and best practices"
**Paste**: Sample Python code with security issues

**[Show analysis results]**

"Within seconds, it identifies:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues
- Best practice violations
- Specific fix suggestions"

"This demonstrates integration with multiple tools beyond just AWS services."

### Demo 4: Human Approval Workflow (2:00 - 2:20)

**[Screen: Destructive action demo]**

"For safety, critical actions require approval."

**Type**: "Terminate all stopped EC2 instances"

**[Show approval request]**

"The agent recognizes this is destructive and requests approval before executing. This human-in-the-loop design ensures safety while maintaining autonomy for routine tasks."

### Architecture & Technical Highlights (2:20 - 2:45)

**[Screen: Architecture diagram]**

"Let me show you the architecture:

- **AWS Bedrock** with Claude 3 Sonnet for autonomous reasoning
- **DynamoDB** for conversation history and state
- **Lambda functions** for serverless compute
- **S3** for knowledge base and RAG
- **Multiple integrated tools** for different capabilities

Everything runs on AWS, fully scalable and production-ready."

### Conclusion (2:45 - 3:00)

**[Screen: GitHub repo and documentation]**

"The entire project is open source with:
- Complete source code
- Deployment scripts
- Comprehensive documentation
- Ready to deploy to your AWS account

This demonstrates how AWS Bedrock enables true agentic AI - autonomous reasoning, multi-tool integration, and real-world problem solving.

Thank you!"

## Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Developer Onboarding

**Context**: A new developer needs to understand the infrastructure.

**Query**: "Give me an overview of our production infrastructure"

**Expected Agent Behavior**:
1. Query EC2 instances
2. List Lambda functions
3. Check S3 buckets
4. Review RDS databases
5. Generate comprehensive summary

### Scenario 2: Production Incident

**Context**: Application is experiencing high latency.

**Query**: "My API is slow. Help me troubleshoot what's causing the latency"

**Expected Agent Behavior**:
1. Check CloudWatch metrics
2. Analyze Lambda timeout rates
3. Review RDS connection stats
4. Check EC2 CPU utilization
5. Provide diagnosis and recommendations

### Scenario 3: Cost Spike Investigation

**Context**: AWS bill increased unexpectedly.

**Query**: "My AWS bill doubled this month. What happened and how can I fix it?"

**Expected Agent Behavior**:
1. Query Cost Explorer for changes
2. Identify top cost increases
3. Analyze resource utilization
4. Suggest rightsizing
5. Recommend reservation purchases

### Scenario 4: Security Audit

**Context**: Need to ensure security best practices.

**Query**: "Audit my AWS account for security vulnerabilities"

**Expected Agent Behavior**:
1. Check S3 bucket policies
2. Review IAM roles and permissions
3. Verify encryption settings
4. Check security group configurations
5. Generate security report

### Scenario 5: Deployment Automation

**Context**: Need to deploy a new version.

**Query**: "Deploy the latest version of my application to production with zero downtime"

**Expected Agent Behavior**:
1. Create deployment plan
2. Request approval (destructive action)
3. Update Lambda functions
4. Monitor health checks
5. Confirm successful deployment
