# DevOps Intelligence Agent

## üöÄ Overview

DevOps Intelligence Agent is an autonomous AI-powered assistant that helps development teams manage cloud infrastructure, optimize deployments, analyze code, and troubleshoot issues using advanced reasoning capabilities powered by AWS Bedrock.

## üéØ Real-World Problem

DevOps teams face challenges with:
- Complex infrastructure management across multiple services
- Time-consuming troubleshooting and debugging
- Security vulnerabilities and cost optimization
- Manual deployment workflows and configuration management

Our AI agent autonomously handles these tasks, reducing response time from hours to minutes.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### AWS Services Used
- **Amazon Bedrock (Nova Pro)**: Primary reasoning LLM for autonomous decision-making
- **Amazon Bedrock Agents**: AgentCore primitives for orchestration
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless execution for agent actions
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: Conversation history and agent state
- **Amazon S3**: Document storage for RAG
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Monitoring and logging
- **AWS Secrets Manager**: API key management

### Agent Capabilities
1. **Autonomous Reasoning**: Uses Claude Sonnet/Nova Pro for complex decision-making
2. **Multi-Tool Integration**:
   - Code execution and analysis
   - Web search for documentation
   - RAG for internal knowledge base
   - AWS API integration for infrastructure management
3. **Action Taking**: Can execute AWS CLI commands, deploy resources, and modify configurations
4. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Optional approval workflow for critical actions

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

### 1. Infrastructure Management
- Automated resource provisioning and scaling
- Cost optimization recommendations
- Security compliance checking
- Performance monitoring and alerts

### 2. Code Intelligence
- Automated code review and analysis
- Bug detection and fix suggestions
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Best practices recommendations

### 3. Deployment Automation
- CI/CD pipeline orchestration
- Rollback capabilities
- Blue-green deployment strategies
- Automated testing integration

### 4. Troubleshooting Assistant
- Log analysis and error detection
- Root cause analysis
- Automated remediation suggestions
- Interactive debugging support

## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- AWS CLI configured
- Node.js 18+ (for frontend)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/devops-intelligence-agent.git
cd devops-intelligence-agent
```

2. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure AWS credentials:
```bash
aws configure
```

4. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

5. Deploy the infrastructure:
```bash
cd infrastructure
python deploy.py
```

6. Start the application:
```bash
# Backend
python src/main.py

# Frontend (separate terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## üöÄ Deployment

### AWS Deployment

The project includes automated deployment scripts:

```bash
# Deploy to AWS
python deploy_aws.py --region us-east-1
```

This will:
1. Create necessary AWS resources
2. Deploy Lambda functions
3. Set up API Gateway
4. Configure Bedrock agents
5. Deploy the frontend to S3/CloudFront

## üí° Usage

### Web Interface
Access the agent at: `https://your-cloudfront-domain.com`

### API
```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.your-domain.com/agent/chat",
    json={
        "message": "Analyze my EC2 cost optimization opportunities",
        "session_id": "user-123"
    }
)
```

### Example Queries
- "Analyze my AWS infrastructure and suggest cost optimizations"
- "Review the code in my repository and identify security issues"
- "Deploy my application to production with zero downtime"
- "Why is my Lambda function timing out? Help me debug it"
